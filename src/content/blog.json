      "content": "React Hooks have revolutionized how we write components. They allow you to use state and other React features without writing a class. The `useState` hook lets you add state to functional components, while `useEffect` lets you perform side effects, such as fetching data or subscribing to events. By combining these and other hooks, you can build complex and powerful components with simpler, more readable code."
